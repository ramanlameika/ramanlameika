- ðŸ‘‹Hi, Iâ€™m Raman Lameika! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my open-source journey, where the boundaries of learning are defined only by curiosity and determination. ðŸš€
ðŸŒŸ About Me

I'm passionate about acquiring knowledge without the constraints of formal degreesâ€”embracing a "nondegree degree" philosophy. Whether it's Infosec, Linux, OSINT, Computer Science, Python, Philosophy, or Grappling and MMA, I'm continuously exploring new domains with enthusiasm and flexibility.

My mantra?
"Never Too Late to Learn."
ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Exploring

    Infosec: Delving deep into the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
    Python: Building tools, solving problems, and scripting my way through challenges.
    Philosophy: Understanding the "why" behind the "what."
    Grappling: Sharpening the mind and body through the art of combat.
    And so much more!
