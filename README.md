 👋 Hi, I’m Raman Lameika! 👋

Welcome to my open-source journey, where the boundaries of learning are defined only by curiosity and determination. 🚀 

## 🌟 About Me

I'm passionate about acquiring knowledge without the constraints of formal degrees—embracing a "nondegree degree" philosophy. Whether it's Infosec, Linux, OSINT, Computer Science, Python, Philosophy, or Grappling and MMA, I'm continuously exploring new domains with enthusiasm and flexibility.

My mantra? **"Never Too Late to Learn."**

## 💡 What I’m Exploring

- **Infosec:** Delving deep into the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
- **Linux:** Self-education and resources.
- **OSINT:** Self-education and resources.
- **Python:** Building tools, solving problems, and scripting my way through challenges.
- **Philosophy:** Understanding the "why" behind the "what."
- **Grappling:** Sharpening the mind and body through the art of combat.
- And so much more!
